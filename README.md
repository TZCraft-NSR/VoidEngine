# --- VoidEngine ---
### --- An engine that runs with Microsoft XNA. ---
---
I created this engine for a easy way to code games for my *Video Game Design* class, at *Sno-Isle tech*. Some of this code I got from my teacher, who got these parts from his own knowledge or a *Microsoft XNA book*. The rest of this code I have created. This engine runs on *.NET 4.0* and *XNA 4.0*.

In order to add this engine to your games code, you must download a release, or if you want to see the code for your self you can download the source. The code however cannot be modified. When you download the release, open your project in Visual Studio. And add the DLL/Project to your resources. If you are using the source code for your project, you must add the project source code to your solution.
> No Release added yet. I will add one in the future when the builds become more stable.
